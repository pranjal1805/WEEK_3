# WEEK_3
**HELLO THERE**
I have uploaded the Jupyter notebook.
In the course, they used the imutils library, but this wasn't installed on my system so I downloaded it.

If there are some changes/feedback can I get one week to implement it? 

This week the both the assignments were a bit tough ðŸ˜…

**Cheers!**
